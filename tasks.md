# Demo Recorder - Enhanced Features Implementation Tasks

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: UI Infrastructure Updates

### Frontend Structure (refer to reference_code.md file)
- [ ] Replace `src/renderer/index.html` with enhanced version (add new sections for zoom/mouse controls)

- [ ] Add source type tabs (Screen/Window/Browser Tab) functionality
- [ ] Implement toggle switches for zoom and mouse tracking features
- [ ] Add range sliders for zoom level, speed, sensitivity, highlight size
- [ ] Add color picker for mouse highlight color

### Source Selection Enhancement  
- [ ] Update `desktopCapturer.getSources()` to categorize by type (screen/window)
- [ ] Add mock browser tab sources (prepare for future implementation)
- [ ] Implement source filtering and dynamic loading based on selected tab
- [ ] Add source thumbnails and improved selection UI

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Core Recording Features

### Audio Enhancement
- [ ] Add audio device enumeration (`navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`)
- [ ] Implement system audio + microphone mixing
- [ ] Add audio settings to recording configuration
- [ ] Update recording constraints based on UI audio settings

### Quality & Settings
- [ ] Implement quality settings (High/Medium/Low) with proper video constraints
- [ ] Add framerate selection functionality
- [ ] Create settings persistence (save/load user preferences)
- [ ] Add configuration validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: Smart Zoom Implementation

### Mouse Tracking Service
- [ ] Create `src/services/MouseTracker.js` class
- [ ] Add IPC handler for real-time mouse position (`ipcMain.handle('get-mouse-position')`)
- [ ] Implement mouse movement detection and activity hotspots
- [ ] Add zoom trigger detection (mouse/click/keyboard/both)

### Zoom Processing
- [ ] Create `src/services/ZoomProcessor.js` for video stream processing
- [ ] Implement Canvas-based zoom transformations
- [ ] Add smooth zoom transitions and animations
- [ ] Apply zoom effects to MediaStream during recording

### Activity Detection
- [ ] Add mouse click detection for zoom triggers
- [ ] Implement sensitivity-based zoom activation
- [ ] Add keyboard activity monitoring (optional)

### Post-Processing Module
- [ ] Create `src/services/PostProcessor.js` for recorded video analysis
- [ ] Detect universal UI elements from frames (buttons, text fields, menus)
- [ ] Analyze mouse movement to infer intent patterns
- [ ] Build activity heatmap to plan camera movements
- [ ] Integrate post-processing step into export workflow

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4: Mouse Highlighting & Effects

### Cursor Overlay System
- [ ] Create `src/services/CursorOverlay.js` class
- [ ] Implement cursor highlight rendering with customizable size/color
- [ ] Add click animation effects (ripple, pulse, ring, none)
- [ ] Create overlay canvas for mouse effects

### Stream Compositing
- [ ] Implement canvas compositing (original stream + cursor overlay + zoom)
- [ ] Ensure smooth performance (30/60fps)
- [ ] Add real-time preview of mouse effects

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 5: Backend Integration

### Enhanced Main Process
- [ ] Add new IPC handlers for zoom/mouse configuration
- [ ] Update `src/main.js` with new menu shortcuts for enhanced features
- [ ] Add settings persistence to main process
- [ ] Handle cross-platform mouse position tracking

### Renderer Process Updates
- [ ] Update `src/renderer/renderer.js` with new UI event handlers
- [ ] Implement configuration state management
- [ ] Add real-time preview updates for zoom/mouse settings
- [ ] Update recording pipeline to include effects processing

### Service Architecture
- [ ] Create `src/services/` directory structure
- [ ] Implement `ConfigManager.js` for settings management
- [ ] Create `StreamProcessor.js` for unified stream processing
- [ ] Add utility functions in `src/utils/` for canvas and stream operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 6: Testing & Polish

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test all zoom configurations and triggers
- [ ] Verify mouse highlighting and click effects
- [ ] Test recording quality with effects enabled
- [ ] Test audio recording with new settings

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Optimize canvas operations for smooth performance
- [ ] Test memory usage during extended recordings
- [ ] Ensure cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Add error handling for edge cases

### UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Add loading states for source refreshing
- [ ] Implement proper disabled states for controls
- [ ] Add tooltips or help text for new features
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 7: Final Integration

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test complete recording workflow with all features
- [ ] Verify saved recordings include zoom and mouse effects
- [ ] Test pause/resume functionality with effects
- [ ] Validate file saving and playback

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with new features
- [ ] Add feature descriptions and usage instructions
- [ ] Document any new dependencies or requirements

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Priority Order:**
1. Start with Phase 1 (UI Infrastructure) - foundation for everything else
2. Move to Phase 2 (Core Recording) - essential functionality
3. Implement Phase 3 (Smart Zoom) - major new feature
4. Add Phase 4 (Mouse Effects) - visual enhancements
5. Complete Phase 5 (Backend Integration) - make it all work together
6. Finish with Phases 6-7 (Testing & Polish) - ensure quality

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Begin with updating the HTML structure (`src/renderer/index.html`)
- [ ] Update CSS with new theme and controls
- [ ] Test basic UI functionality before moving to backend features
